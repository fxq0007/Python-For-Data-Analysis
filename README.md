## Python-For-Data-Analysis
In this repository, I implemented some of the code from the book 'Python For Data Analysis 2nd edition' by Juypter notebook. 
A Python tutorial is included in the ipynb file named 'Python coding stuff' just in case for me to catch up some  Python basics before proceed to data analysis tasks.

File list: (all implemented by Python version 3.8.3)
- `Python For Data Analysis.ipynb`
- `Python coding stuff.ipynb`
